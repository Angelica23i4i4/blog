## How to create a good presentation

1. Formulate a topic
It is difficult to listen to an interlocutor who jumps from one thing to another, so the presentation should have only one topic. Otherwise it will be a long story about nothing. The topic should be narrow enough to provide a solution to the problem at the end. Narrow the topic until the presentation can be summarized in ten short paragraphs.

It is easy to identify a good topic - it itself suggests the structure of the speech.

2. Define your goal
A good presentation changes the existing picture of the world. For example, people are starting to be more environmentally friendly or running for a new smartphone. The goal does not have to be ambitious, the main thing is specific.

A good presentation goal begins with a question: What do I want to change in the audience's behavior?


3. Think through the scenario
The purpose of the presentation is what you want to change in the listener's mind, and the script is how you will achieve these changes.

Imagine that you are making up a story. The listener needs to be intrigued, come up with an interesting character, and lead him through difficulties to a successful ending. This is the basic structure of any text and presentation. Fairy tales, film scripts, and product advertisements are based on this structure:
1) Bring you up to date.
2) Intrigue
3) Thesis. This is the main motive of the presentation, what you want to teach people.
4) Antithesis. Show the other side of the coin. This builds trust and warns against problems that a person may encounter in practice.
5) Conclusion. A bad presentation ends with “that’s all.” Conclude with a short summary or conclusion. After your speech, the person should understand what he can do right now.

4. Show examples
Less theory - more life. Show how your product works and how people use it.
Real stories of people, screenshots of programs and live photographs of the product look more convincing than dry text and photos from stock photos.

5. Alternate slides
Presentation is like text. If the text consists of sentences of the same length and the same type, reading will be boring. No rhythm. Therefore, alternate text slides and slides with images, add graphics. Sometimes you can joke.

6. Tell me what to do next
A bad speech ends with: “That’s it, now the questions.” This way you leave the listener alone with his thoughts.

A good presentation gives clear instructions on what to do next. This is not necessarily a call to action. At the end, you can go over the conclusions again, emphasize the main thesis, or tell where to get additional information.

7. Fewer flowers
The presentation should have 1-2 primary colors. For example, for background, text and icons. Follow the chosen sequence and do not change colors unnecessarily. Choosing colors on your own is quite difficult, especially if you are not a designer. If you're making a corporate presentation, use brand colors.

If there are no corporate colors, use Tilda Colors. Copy the color you like by clicking on its code or on the color palette.


8. More contrast
White on blue can look nice on your Retina computer. But if you have to show the presentation through a projector, the text will not be read. Therefore, use contrasting colors. The biggest contrast: black and white. The rest can be checked using the contrast testing service.


9. Fewer fonts
One font is enough to create a presentation. Take a modern sans serif font: Tilda Sans, Open Sans, Roboto, PT Sans (these fonts are free to use). These are simple fonts that are easy to read. It's easy to check: step away from the screen and try to read the headline. If it's easy to read, you guessed it. Emphases can be made by changing the font weight.

10. Rule of thirds
This rule for creating presentations helps to arrange objects on a slide so that the eye immediately highlights the most important things. Divide the slide into thirds lengthwise and crosswise. Place significant objects at intersections. Significant objects are headings and illustrations.


11. The texts are shorter
One slide - one thought. This slide is easy to read and remember. If you are speaking in public, it will maintain the audience's attention. Exactly how much text will be on the slide depends on the size of the audience. If a person is reading a presentation on the screen, a paragraph of text will not scare him. If you are speaking to an audience of a hundred people, it will be difficult to read more than ten words on a slide.

12. Calculate how many slides should be in the presentation
A simple rule that can be taken as a basis when creating presentations is one slide per minute. If your speech is designed for 30 minutes, then the optimal number of slides is also 30!


13. Add images
Photos and icons help to highlight the content, but should not replace it. If you find a beautiful “on-topic” photo that doesn’t help convey the idea, don’t use it.


14.Make friends slides
In a presentation, all elements should be friendly, that is, be of the same type. Then it is perceived easily because it meets expectations.

Make several templates for each type of slide: a slide with text, an image, a graph. Then simply duplicate the slides and change only the text and images.

A presentation where the same type of elements occupy the same place on each slide looks neat.
