## Description of the school week

1. I took a course in machine learning and completed quite a lot. I plan to make my own project based on it.
2. I had a lot of laboratory work, but I managed to do everything.
3. Didnâ€™t have time to do math


## Hobbies

I found people with whom I will practice English and German. We communicate quite friendly. I also found people with whom I regularly study machine learning as a team.
